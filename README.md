# CiveGpt: A Comprehensive College Navigation and Connection App for CIVE and UDOM Students

## Project Overview
**CiveGpt** is a web and mobile application designed to enhance the college experience for students at the College of Informatics and Virtual Education (CIVE) and the broader University of Dodoma (UDOM). By leveraging the **Grok API** (provided by xAI), the app aims to provide life-saving, practical, and impactful features that address critical student needs, including academic success, campus navigation, mental health support, safety, and career preparation. The app is built to be intuitive, accessible, and deeply integrated with the unique needs of CIVE and UDOM students, fostering a supportive and connected community.

This document outlines the essential features to build for **CiveGpt**, focusing on life-saving and high-impact functionalities that prioritize student well-being, academic excellence, and safety. Each feature is designed to leverage the Grok API for intelligent, personalized assistance while aligning with the technical stack outlined in the MVP (React for frontend, FastAPI for backend, and SQLite for initial data storage).

## Design and Implementation Considerations
To ensure **CiveGpt** is effective, accessible, and scalable, consider the following:

- **UI/UX**:
  - **Design**: Use a clean, modern interface with UDOM’s colors (e.g., green and gold) to foster school pride. Support dark/light modes and high-contrast options for accessibility.
  - **Navigation**: Implement a bottom navigation bar (Home, Map, Chat, Resources, Profile) for mobile ease. Use clear icons (e.g., MapPin for navigation, BookOpen for academics).
  - **Onboarding**: Include a Grok-powered tutorial to guide new users through features.
  - **Tech**: Use React components for modularity, Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, Framer Motion for subtle animations.

- **Accessibility**:
  - Support screen readers, keyboard navigation, and multilingual options (Swahili and English).
  - Ensure map and emergency features are accessible for students with disabilities (e.g., text-based directions, voice commands).

- **Performance**:
  - Optimize for low-bandwidth environments (common in Tanzania) by compressing images, caching data, and using lazy loading for heavy components (e.g., maps).
  - Cache frequent Grok queries (e.g., directions, academic FAQs) to reduce API calls and stay within free-tier limits.

- **Security and Privacy**:
  - Use HTTPS and secure WebSocket for all data transfers.
  - Implement strict anonymization for feedback and emergency features.
  - Clearly communicate privacy policies in the app.

- **Scalability**:
  - Design the backend (FastAPI) to support additional features without major refactoring.
  - Use a modular database schema (SQLite for MVP, scalable to PostgreSQL for larger user bases).
  - Plan for potential expansion to other UDOM colleges or universities.

## Sample User Scenarios
To illustrate the life-saving impact, here are example user scenarios:

1. **Emergency Navigation**: A student walking alone at night feels unsafe and uses the Emergency Alert System to send their location to campus security, receiving a response within minutes.
2. **Academic Stress Relief**: A freshman struggling with a coding assignment asks Grok, “Explain recursion in simple terms,” and receives a clear explanation, reducing anxiety and improving their work.
3. **Mental Health Support**: A student feeling overwhelmed uses the Mental Health Resource Hub to book a counseling session and asks Grok for stress management tips, helping them cope during exams.
4. **Career Preparation**: A final-year student finds a tech internship via the Career Corner, uses Grok to refine their resume, and secures a job offer, ensuring financial stability post-graduation.
