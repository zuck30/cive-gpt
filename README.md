## Design and Implementation Considerations

To ensure **CiveGpt** is effective, accessible, and scalable, the following considerations are critical:

### UI/UX Design
- **Theme**: Adopt a clean, modern interface using UDOM’s colors (e.g., green and gold, if applicable) to foster school pride. Support dark and light modes for accessibility.
- **Navigation**: Implement a bottom navigation bar with icons for key sections (Home, Map, Chat, Resources, Profile) to ensure mobile-friendly access.
- **Onboarding**: Provide a Grok-powered tutorial to guide new users through features, ensuring ease of adoption.
- **Tech**: Use React for modular components, Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, and Framer Motion for subtle animations (e.g., button transitions).

### Accessibility
- Support screen readers, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast modes for visually impaired users.
- Offer multilingual support (Swahili and English) to cater to UDOM’s diverse student body.
- Ensure navigation and emergency features are accessible for students with disabilities (e.g., text-based directions, voice command support).

### Performance
- Optimize for low-bandwidth environments common in Tanzania by compressing images, caching data, and using lazy loading for heavy components (e.g., maps, chat histories).
- Cache frequent Grok queries (e.g., common directions, academic FAQs) in SQLite to stay within free-tier API limits.

### Security and Privacy
- Use HTTPS and secure WebSocket for all data transfers to protect user information.
- Implement strict anonymization for sensitive features (e.g., emergency alerts, anonymous feedback) to comply with privacy standards.
- Clearly communicate privacy policies in the app, emphasizing data protection.

### Scalability
- Design the FastAPI backend to support additional features without major refactoring.
- Use a modular SQLite database schema for the MVP, with plans to scale to PostgreSQL for larger user bases.
- Plan for potential expansion to other UDOM colleges or Tanzanian universities.
